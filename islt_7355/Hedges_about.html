        About Me
    </h3>
    <p>
        I teach the architectural structures sequence at Drury and am a registered architect. I have taught full-time for nearly twenty years and have developed a teaching repertoire exceeding twenty courses for architecture and engineering university degree granting programs. The courses range from architectural design to engineering technologies. <br> <br>I have over thirty refereed papers and two dozen presentations mostly regarding emergent pedagogies and the nature of digital technologies intervening in higher education. I have presented my work at venues such as the <em>University of Oxford</em> and the <em>Eidgen√∂ssische Technische Hochschule</em>. I earned two national AIA awards for innovative curriculum development through the AIA Technology in Architectural Practice (TAP) BIM Awards. I was published twice in The AIA Report on University Research (Volumes 4 and 5). I am most proud of being the editor-in-chief of the <b> Architectural Graphic Standards (Student Edition)</b>.
