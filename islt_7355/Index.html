<h4><p>Welcome to my website. I am Keith Hedges.</p></h4>
<p>This portfolio website showcases my professional development activities. As a full-time educator, we are responsible to create and fulfill our own continuing education. I have chosen to take courses through University of Missouri, College of Education, Department of Information Science and Learning Technologies. The courses involve learning technologies and design. The website houses several educational artifacts, or projects, that I have completed either individually or as part of a group. The projects respond to the three primary goals and associated learning objectives set forth by the department. The competencies are: the design and development of learning systems, front-end analysis and system evaluation, and technology leadership and social responsibility.</p>
