            <h1><br>Teaching Philosophy</h1>
            <p class="intro">I use the characteristics of the learners to inform my teaching. Although I instruct the architectural technologies courses, the liberal arts and the studio culture shape the life experiences and learning preferences of the design student. Boyer and Mitgang (1996) described the student experience, “For much of this century, design has dominated the architecture curriculum at nearly all schools. It is a place – the design studio – where students spend as much as 90% of their time and energy.” The students apply the design learning preference to the structures sequence. Architecture students may perceive narrow engineering problems as ordinary, and will continue to search for a broad meaning. When provided with a broad contextualization in advance, their satisfaction and performance improve.

                        Based on the learner characteristics, I have developed a reverse content sequence, parti pris, pedagogy that begins with a central big idea prior to its refinement. The introductory structures course commences with the effects of wind and earthquakes on buildings, progresses with the effects of gravity loads on horizontal framing systems, then concludes with the principles of rigid body statics and mechanics of deformable bodies. This content sequence is the opposite of traditional programs at the larger land grant institutions that progress from one course in statics, followed by mechanics, steel design, and reinforced concrete design while lateral forces are absent until graduate school.
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <p>
                        I align the learning objectives and instruction with the student outcomes and assessments. I use a backward design approach where I begin with goals and create assessments prior to engaging the lesson plans. Each course has anywhere from 3 to 8 broad goals and 10 to 50 specific learning objectives. The learning objectives are supported by traditional classroom whiteboard instruction and through asynchronous videos, course notes, formulas, and practice problems prior to assessment. The student outcomes vary from traditional exams to numerical computations to detailed drawings. Since I provide a specific set of learning objectives, it is possible to establish an expected level of knowledge where achievement is measured relative to a fixed standard. Therefore, I employ an adjusted-percentage method in an absolute grading system for the first two structures courses. The notion is that the course grade reflects achievement with the course goals and effort is directly rewarded. For the studio-based capstone course, I employ a distribution-gap method in a relative grading system.

                        I use professional development and scholarship to improve and renew my teaching. I am taking graduate-level courses through the University of Missouri. Several courses are situated in Information Science and Learning Technologies. I have implemented many ideas and processes such as gaming, rapid development tools, interaction design, instructional systems design, learning analytics, Moodle, and teaching online courses. Integrating the Moodle learning management system is my most recent passion. This has been fueled by the pandemic. I frequently think and write about teaching and technology to seek feedback from my peers.
