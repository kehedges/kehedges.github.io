Hello everyone, I am Keith Hedges. I am a licensed architect, educator, and lifelong learner. I teach the architectural structures sequence at Drury University. I have been teaching for nearly twenty years. I am also a graduate student at Mizzou. I enjoy taking the ISLT courses. I am enrolled in the web design and front end analysis classes this semester. I know very little about web design and HTML, and hope to be able to build my own webpage. I met my much better half in high school in the early 1980s. We have a daughter just starting college at Drury. Our son is a high school freshman in the Ozarks. I enjoy playing tennis and chess when I can find the time. I finally cracked, and got my first cell phone last year. I am slowing catching up with technology!
